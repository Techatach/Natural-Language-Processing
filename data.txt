a. Lexical Analysis:
With lexical analysis, we divide a whole chunk of text into paragraphs, sentences, and words. It involves identifying and analyzing words’ structure.
b. Syntactic Analysis:
Syntactic analysis involves the analysis of words in a sentence for grammar and arranging words in a manner that shows the relationship among the words. For instance, the sentence “The shop goes to the house” does not pass.
c. Semantic Analysis:
Semantic analysis draws the exact meaning for the words, and it analyzes the text meaningfulness. Sentences such as “hot ice-cream” do not pass.
d. Disclosure Integration:
Disclosure integration takes into account the context of the text. It considers the meaning of the sentence before it ends. For example: “He works at Google.” In this sentence, “he” must be referenced in the sentence before it.
e. Pragmatic Analysis:
Pragmatic analysis deals with overall communication and interpretation of language. It deals with deriving meaningful use of language in various situations.
